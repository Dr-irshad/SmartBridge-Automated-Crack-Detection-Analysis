## 🏗️ Overview  

**SmartBridge** is an **AI-powered bridge crack detection and analysis framework** that leverages **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** to autonomously identify, analyze, and report structural defects.  

The system introduces a new paradigm in **automated structural health monitoring (SHM)** by integrating intelligent agents that collaborate to maximize detection accuracy, minimize false alarms, and enable **real-time infrastructure risk assessment**.  

> Designed for integration with drones, robotic platforms, and smart IoT systems for large-scale bridge inspection and preventive maintenance.
