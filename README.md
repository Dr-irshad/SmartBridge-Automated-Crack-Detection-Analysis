# SmartBridge: Automated Crack Detection & Analysis

## Overview
SmartBridge is an AI-powered bridge crack detection system utilizing a customized YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to enhance crack detection accuracy. This project enables real-time and automated structural health monitoring of bridges, reducing manual inspection efforts and improving infrastructure safety.

## Features
- **Customized YOLO Model:** Fine-tuned for bridge crack detection
- **Real-Time Processing:** Efficient and fast crack identification
- **High Accuracy:** Optimized for minimal false positives and false negatives
- **Easy Integration:** Can be deployed on drones, robots, or handheld devices
- **Data Logging & Reporting:** Generates reports for maintenance planning

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (if needed)
- YOLO Framework

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dr-irshad/SmartBridge-Automated-Crack-Detection-Analysis.git
cd SmartBridge-Automated-Crack-Detection-Analysis
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation
1. Collect bridge crack images and label them using tools like **LabelImg**.
2. Organize dataset:
   ```
   ├── dataset
   │   ├── images
   │   │   ├── train
   │   │   ├── val
   │   │   ├── test
   │   ├── labels
   │   │   ├── train
   │   │   ├── val
   │   │   ├── test
   ```
3. Convert annotations to YOLO format.

## Training the Model
To train the customized YOLO model:
```bash
python src/concrete_train.py 
```

## Deployment
For real-time deployment, use:
```bash
python src/live_detect.py --weights best.pt --source 0  # 0 for webcam, video path for pre-recorded footage
```

## Results & Visualization
- Detected cracks will be marked with bounding boxes.
- Reports can be exported in JSON or CSV format.
