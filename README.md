# SmartBridge: Automated Crack Detection & Analysis

## Overview

SmartBridge is an AI-powered bridge crack detection system that leverages a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to enhance detection accuracy. This system enables real-time and automated structural health monitoring of bridges, significantly reducing the need for manual inspections and improving infrastructure safety.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent System**: Utilizes multiple agents to collaboratively optimize crack detection strategies.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Provides efficient and rapid identification of cracks through simultaneous decision-making.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs optimized learning algorithms to minimize false positives and false negatives.
- **Scalable Integration**: Designed for deployment on drones, robots, or handheld devices for versatile monitoring solutions.
- **Data Logging & Reporting**: Automatically generates detailed reports for informed maintenance planning.

## Dataset Preparation
1. Collect bridge crack images and label them using tools like **LabelImg**.
2. Organize dataset:
   ```
   ├── dataset
   │   ├── images
   │   │   ├── train
   │   │   ├── val
   │   │   ├── test
   │   ├── labels
   │   │   ├── train
   │   │   ├── val
   │   │   ├── test
   ```
3. Convert annotations to YOLO format.

## Training the Model
To train the customized YOLO model:
```bash
python src/concrete_train.py 
```

## Deployment
For real-time deployment, use:
```bash
python src/live_detect.py --weights best.pt --source 0  # 0 for webcam, video path for pre-recorded footage
```

## Results & Visualization
- Detected cracks will be marked with bounding boxes.
- Reports can be exported in JSON or CSV format.
